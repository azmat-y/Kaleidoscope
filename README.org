* Kaleidoscope
Writing a compiler for a toy language Kaleidoscope by following the tutorial mentioned here [[https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html][Implementing Language with LLVM]]
** Why ?
Compilers felt like a cheat code to me with how much efficient they are in generating native executables. To demystify it, I decided on building one to understand how one might work.
** Quickstart
To build the program insure that you have cmake and g++ installed and in your path.
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/azmat-y/Kaleidoscope
cd Kaleidoscope
mkdir build
cmake --preset=release # generate cmake files
cmake --build build    # build the project
#+end_src
